# Introduction to coding with Python

_These are class notes_ for a group of elememtary and middle school students who have learned fundamentals of programming and are comfortable with the Scratch block-based programming language. They learned using Google's CSFirst platform.

We meet 1h/week, have minimal homework, and are starting by loosely following the textbook [Python for Kids](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Kids-Playful-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593274076). The primary goal is for the students to have fun. The curriculum will be guided by student interests.

### Lesson 1: 

- From Scratch to Python
- Introduction to the Python console
- Operators +,-,*,/,>,<
- Numbers and Strings
- Variables  
- Lists
- Subsetting lists

**class notes / code snpippets:** [lesson_1.py](https://github.com/dlebauer/intro-python/blob/master/lesson_1.py)

**Homework:** Use variables and operators to solve one of your homework problems

### Lesson 2: 

- Intro to the Interactive Development Environments (IDE)
  - a text file and a console
  - we will start with a blank 'Trinket' https://trinket.io/python3/9fa205cb41?runMode=console
- lists
- the `print` statement
- string substitution
- for loops and indexing

**Homework**:

- Use a list, a for loop, and operators to solve the following:

On Monday you find a goose that lays diamond eggs. It lays the first egg that day, and you take it to a jewelery store. The owner says it is worth 3 million dollars! On Tuesday you find out that it lays one egg per day. Write a for loop program that tells you how much many diamonds you will have on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday and how much they will be worth. Specifically, write a loop that prints the following output:

```python
On Tuesday you have 2 eggs worth 3 million dollars
On Wednesday you have 2 eggs worth 6 million dollars
On Thursday you have 3 eggs worth 9 million dollars
On Friday you have 4 eggs worth 12 million dollars
```

Hint: see the [lesson 2 notes](https://github.com/dlebauer/intro-python/blob/master/lesson_2.py)

### Lesson 3:

- review homework
  - solve homework w/ dictionaries
  - create vectors eggs and value
  - plot eggs vs value
- draw pictures with turtles? (or lesson 4)
