# Introduction to coding with Python

Textbook: [Python for Kids](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Kids-Playful-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593274076)

### Lesson 1: 


- From Scratch to Python
- Introduction to the Python console
- Operators +,-,*,/,>,<
- Numbers and Strings
- Variables  
- Lists
- Subsetting lists

**Homework:** Use variables and operators to solve one of your homework problems

### Lesson 2: 

- Intro to the Interactive Development Environments (IDE)
  - a text file and a console
  - we will start with a blank 'Trinket' https://trinket.io/python3/9fa205cb41?runMode=console
- lists
- the `print` statement
- string substitution
- for loops and indexing

**Homework:** 
- Use a list, a for loop, and operators to solve the following:

On Monday you find a goose that lays diamond eggs. It lays the first egg that day, and you take it to a jewelery store. The owner says it is worth 3 million dollars! On Tuesday you find out that it lays one egg per day. Write a for loop program that tells you how much many diamonds you will have on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday and how much they will be worth. Specifically, it will generate the following:

```python
On Tuesday you have 2 eggs worth 3 million dollars
On Wednesday you have 2 eggs worth 6 million dollars
... #... means and on and on
```

Hint: see the [lesson 2 notes](https://github.com/dlebauer/intro-python/blob/master/lesson_2.py)

### Lesson 3:

- review homework
  - solve homework w/ dictionaries
  - create vectors eggs and value
  - plot eggs vs value
- draw pictures with turtles? (or lesson 4)
